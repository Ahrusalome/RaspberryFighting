## Welcome to our Raspberry Fight project !


# Explanations :

This project was created by two second year students of computer sciences. As part of our programming module, our final exam is a project which consists in the making of a video game working with IOT features as such as joysticks. 🎮

Our game is a fighter which allows two players to compete against each other by using joysticks and buttons. Obviously, the goal is to beat the other one with the given possibilities of attacks and defense of their characters. 🥊  


# Lore : 
It's the chaos in the flatshare. After a tasteful meal, only one spring roll is left. An heated argument results : Paul and Alex must now decide over a showdown which one will inherit it. There can be only one contestant alive... as such as their precious food.
*Who will get the last spring roll ?*
